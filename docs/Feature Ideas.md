Article Features

    AI Summaries
    
        1 - When generating AI summaries, the source page should be considered canon and should inform all subsequent interpolation. In this way, we can correct incorrect assumptions made by the model.

        2 - Link feature: if there's an AI summary already generated, when hovering over the link, display that in a floating modal popup. if not, provide a button to quickly generate an AI summary. On the popup, it should always display the path to the article.

        Add the ability to provide a custom prompt on an article for the AI summary.
        
        Add templated AI summaries so the user can choose what type of summary to create.
    
    Mark as private
    
    Add Azure AI Search as a replacement for the global search
