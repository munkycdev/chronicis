# Chronicis - Feature Ideas & Backlog

## Bugs

### Article
- Sometimes, when I load a long article, scroll down a ways, and type [[, it doesn't load the link autocomplete popup. Sometimes it does. Seems inconsistent.
- The DM can choose to define article templates for various article types

### General
- Make it work on an iPad
    - Figure out how to perform the right-click operations
    - Drag and drop reorganization doesn't work
- Default world that new users get added to as an example of how to use the system
- /change-log seems to be missing some stuff
- Should I consider a different license, if I want to monetize this eventually?

---

## Cleanup

- Run a cleanup to remove all unused code and styles - this includes cleaning up styling overrides for the fixed mud theme
- Buttons everywhere are not using the right color. Maybe have Claude look at everything and do some cleanup?

---

## Session Notes
- Some way to track quests?

---

## Article Features

* Ability to view summaries for external resources/links
- Add Azure AI Search as a replacement for the global search (deferred feature until we need it - it's expensive!)

---

## Campaign and Arc Features

- Add the ability to generate an AI summary of child summary notes - this needs to be implemented first!
    - When the player creates a summary, maybe a parent dated article is created and then a child for the player's notes?
- Perhaps not require an Arc, so can add either an arc or a session?

---

## World Features

* Ability to add maps and track activity across sessions
    - Maps
    - Nights slept
    - Other stuff?

---

## Characters

- Rich character builder

---

## Utilities

- Utility to run add links to all articles in a world
- Utility to suggest pages for regularly recurring topics/people/creatures
- Bulk AI summary generator - displays articles and allows them to be selected for a quick summary creation
