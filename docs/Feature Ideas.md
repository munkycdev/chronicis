# Chronicis - Feature Ideas & Backlog

## Bugs

### Article
- Sometimes, when I load a long article, scroll down a ways, and type [[, it doesn't load the link autocomplete popup. Sometimes it does. Seems inconsistent.

### General
- Make it work on an iPad
    - Figure out how to perform the right-click operations
    - Drag and drop reorganization doesn't work

---

## Styling

- Campaign pages that have an intro blurb - make the textbox grow as large as it needs to
---

## Quick Wins

- Do away with right-click popups where possible
- Run a cleanup to remove all unused code and styles

---

## Article Features

- Mark as private
- Add Azure AI Search as a replacement for the global search
- Ability to link to external documents and view summaries

---

## Campaign and Arc Features

- Add the ability to generate an AI summary of child summary notes
- Perhaps not require an Arc, so can add either an arc or a session?

---

## World Features

- Multi-user setup for worlds, managed by the world owner (GM)
- Ability to add files to the "External Resources" section
- Ability to add maps and track activity across sessions

---

## Utilities

- Utility to run add links to all articles in a world

---

## General / Infrastructure
