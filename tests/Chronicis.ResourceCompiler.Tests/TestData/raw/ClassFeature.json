You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\n**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. *Charm Person*, *Color Spray*, *Dissonant Whispers*, and *Healing Word* are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\n\nIf another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.\n\n**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.\n\n**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.\n\n**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.",

You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\n**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. *Bless*, *Cure Wounds*, *Guiding Bolt*, and *Shield of Faith* are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\n\nIf another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.\n\n**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.\n\n**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.\n\n**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.",

The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class's description.\n\n**Cantrips.** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. *Druidcraft* and *Produce Flame* are recommended.\n\nWhenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list.\n\nWhen you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.\n\n**Spell Slots.** The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\n**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. *Animal Friendship*, *Cure Wounds*, *Faerie Fire*, and *Thunderwave* are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\n\nIf another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.\n\n**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.\n\n**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.\n\n**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.",

You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.\n\n**Number of Uses.** You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nYou gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.\n\n**Known Forms.** You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see \"Animals\" in \"Monsters\" for stat block options). The **Rat**, **Riding Horse**, **Spider**, and **Wolf** are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.\n\nWhen you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.\n\nWhen choosing known forms, you may look in other sources for eligible Beasts if the Game Master permits you to do so.\n\nTable: Beast Shapes\n\n|Druid Level|Known Forms|Max CR|Fly Speed|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|2|4|1/4|No|\n|4|6|1/2|No|\n|8|8|1|Yes|\n\n**Rules While Shape-Shifted.** While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:\n- **Temporary Hit Points.** When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.\n- **Game Statistics.** Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.\n- **No Spellcasting.** You can't cast spells, but shapeshifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you've already cast.\n- **Objects.** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.",

Until the bond ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus.\n\nWhenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type.\n\nYour bond with the weapon ends if you use this feature's Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the bond ends.\n\n### Pact of the Chain\n\nYou learn the *Find Familiar* spell and can cast it as a Magic action without expending a spell slot.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: **Imp, Pseudodragon, Quasit, Skeleton, Sphinx of Wonder, Sprite,** or **Venomous Snake** (see \"Monsters\" for the familiar's stat block).\n\nAdditionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its Reaction.\n\n### Pact of the Tome\n\nStitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in your hand at the end of a Short or Long Rest. This *Book of Shadows* (you determine its appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you can access, granting you the benefits below. The book disappears if you conjure another book with this feature or if you die.\n\n**Cantrips and Rituals.** When the book appears, choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be from any class's spell list, and they must be spells you don't already have prepared. While the book is on your person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and they function as Warlock spells for you.\n\n**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use the book as a Spellcasting Focus.\n\n### Repelling Blast\n\n*Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals Damage via an Attack Roll*\n\nChoose one of your known Warlock cantrips that requires an attack roll.

Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.\n\nWhen you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.\n\n**Spell Slots.** The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5.

You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.\n\nFor example, when you're a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots.

Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.\n\nIf another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.\n\n**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.\n\n**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.\n\n**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.",

    "desc": "As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See \"Spells\" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list later in the class's description.\n\n**Cantrips.** You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. *Light*, *Mage Hand*, and *Ray of Frost* are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.\n\nWhen you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.\n\n**Spellbook.** Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting *Identify*. You determine the book's appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.\n\nThe book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. *Detect Magic*, *Feather Fall*, *Mage Armor*, *Magic Missile*, *Sleep*, and *Thunderwave* are recommended.\n\nWhenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.\n\n**Spell Slots.** The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\n**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.\n\nIf another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.\n\n**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.\n\n**Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.\n\n**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.\n\n> ### Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook\n\n> The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a *Spell Scroll*, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.\n\n>**Copying a Spell into the Book.** When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it's of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.\n\n> **Copying the Book.** You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.\n\n> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.",
