            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Chronicis exists to help tabletop RPG players capture and organize 
                the stories they create together. We believe every campaign deserves 
                to be remembered—not lost in scattered notes and forgotten Discord threads.

            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>
                Chronicis started as a personal project born from frustration. 
                After years of running D&D campaigns and losing track of NPCs, plot threads, 
                and that one important detail from session 12, we decided to build something better.
            </p>
            <p>
                We wanted a tool that thinks like a game master—one that understands 
                relationships between characters, locations, and events. One that helps 
                you find what you need when a player asks "Wait, who was that guy?"
            </p>

            <h2>Built for Players, by Players</h2>
            <p>
                We're tabletop gamers ourselves. We understand the chaos of campaign notes 
                because we've lived it. Chronicis is designed around how we actually play—
                not how some product manager thinks we should.

            <h2>Early Access</h2>
            <p>
                Chronicis is currently in early access. That means we're actively building 
                new features and would love your feedback. If you have ideas, suggestions, 
                or find something that doesn't work quite right, let us know.
