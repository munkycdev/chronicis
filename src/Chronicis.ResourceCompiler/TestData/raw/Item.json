Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\n\nThe *Apparatus of the Crab* is a Large object with the following statistics: AC 20; HP 200; Speed 30 ft., Swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs aren't extended); Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage.\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage each minute from pressure.\n\nA creature in the compartment can take a Utilize action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down.

On an even roll, the treant is Chaotic Good. |\n| 21–30 | An animate but immobile stone statue in your likeness rises and makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are.

The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires a Utilize action. If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. The bag holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside. Placing a Bag of Holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Handy Haversack, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way and can't be reopened.",

A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 − 1 cards.\n\nThe magic of the deck functions only if its cards are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself. An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. The illusory creature created by the card looks and behaves like a real creature of its kind, except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can take a Magic action to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card.\n\nAny physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be false, because objects pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a *Dispel Magic* spell or a similar effect).

On a failed save, the orb imposes the Charmed condition on you for as long as you remain attuned to it.\n\nWhile you are Charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb casts *Suggestion* on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular society or organization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.\n\n**_Spells._** The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.

The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Third Command Word. You expend 5 charges and cause the gem to flare with intense light in a 30 foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.

Each side pouch can hold up to 200 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet. The central pouch can hold up to 500 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The haversack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires a Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top. If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an Artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. Each pouch of the haversack holds enough air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside. Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",

As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits a 30-foot Emanation. When at least one Undead is within that area, the Emanation is filled with Dim Light. Any Undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 Radiant damage. Fire Opal Flames. As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can take a Magic action to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 Fire damage. The flames last until you take a Bonus Action to extinguish them or until you drop or stow the weapon. Ruby Resistance. As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have Resistance to Fire damage. Spells. You can cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: Daylight (opal), Fireball (fire opal), Prismatic Spray (diamond), or Wall of Fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm. Taking Fire Damage. Roll 1d20 if you are wearing the helm and take Fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems and is then destroyed. Each creature within a 60 foot Emanation originating from you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking Radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm.",

While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 4 or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses its magic. Agility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep-red sphere orbits your head. Awareness (Rare). While this dark-blue rhomboid orbits your head, you have Advantage on Initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks. Fortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head. Greater Absorption (Legendary).

A canceled spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses its magic. Insight (Very Rare). Your Wisdom increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head. Intellect (Very Rare). Your Intelligence increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head. Leadership (Very Rare). Your Charisma increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head. Mastery (Legendary). Your Proficiency Bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head. Protection (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class while this dusty-rose prism orbits your head. Regeneration (Legendary). You regain 15 Hit Points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head if you have at least 1 Hit Point. Reserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 4 levels of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM. Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 4 into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses. While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space. Strength (Very Rare). Your Strength increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head. Sustenance (Rare). You don't need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.",

You can take a Magic action to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands. Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target has the Restrained condition until you take a Bonus Action to issue a command that releases it. Doing so or missing with the attack causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more. A creature that can touch the bands, including the one Restrained, can take an action to make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to break the iron bands. On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the Restrained creature is freed. On a failed check, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.

If the flask is empty and the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has Advantage on the save. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't age and doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink. You can take a Magic action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature in the flask. The creature then obeys your commands for 1 hour, understanding those commands even if it doesn't know the language in which the commands are given. If you issue no commands or give the creature a command that is likely to result in its death or imprisonment, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment. An Identify spell reveals if the flask contains a creature, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask.

    "desc": "This fine wooden box contains 1d4 pots of pigment and a brush (weighing 1 pound in total). Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment, you can paint any number of three-dimensional objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors, trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube. The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the number of elements you create), during which time you must remain in the Cube, and requires Concentration. If your Concentration is broken or you leave the Cube before the work is done, all the painted elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted. When the work is done, all the painted objects and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within the 20-foot Cube. No object created by a pot of pigment can have a value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all objects created by a pot of pigment can't exceed 500 GP. If you paint objects of greater value (such as a large pile of gold), they look authentic, but close inspection reveals they're made from paste, cookies, or some other worthless material. If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm.",

    "desc": "When this 4-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage, and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic action and use a command word to activate it. It remains activated until you take a Magic action and repeat the command word to deactivate it. Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the mirror's nature makes the save with Advantage, and Constructs succeed on the save automatically. An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed. If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it. While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate. In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it. Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",

    "desc": "Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column of the Mysterious Deck table when randomly determining cards drawn from the deck.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\n\nOnce a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, reroll on the table if that card comes up again.)\n\nTable: Mysterious Deck\n\n| 1d100 (13-Card Deck) | 1d100 (22-Card Deck) | Card    |\n|----------------------|----------------------|---------|\n| —                    | 01–05                | Balance |\n| —                    | 06–10                | Comet   |\n| —                    | 11–14                | Donjon  |\n| 01–08                | 15–18                | Euryale |\n| —                    | 19–23                | Fates   |\n| 09–16                | 24–27                | Flames  |\n| —                    | 28–31                | Fool    |\n| —                    | 32–36                | Gem     |\n| 17–24                | 37–41                | Jester  |\n| 25–32                | 42–46                | Key     |\n| 33–40                | 47–51                | Knight  |\n| 41–48                | 52–56                | Moon    |\n| —                    | 57–60                | Puzzle  |\n| 49–56                | 61–64                | Rogue   |\n| 57–64                | 65–68                | Ruin    |\n| —                    | 69–73                | Sage    |\n| 65–72                | 74–77                | Skull   |\n| 73–80                | 78–82                | Star    |\n| 81–88                | 83–87                | Sun     |\n| —                    | 88–91                | Talons  |\n| 89–96                | 92–96                | Throne  |\n| 97–00                | 97–00                | Void    |\n\nEach card's effect is described below.\n\n**_Balance._** You can increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also decrease another one of your ability scores by 2. You can't decrease an ability that has a score of 5 or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has no effect.\n\n**_Comet._** The next time you enter combat against one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat, you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1 year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 Hit Points or you don't choose a foe, this card has no effect.\n\n**_Euryale._** The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse.\n\n**_Fates._** Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\n**_Flames._** A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\n**_Fool._** You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn't count as one of your declared draws.\n\n**_Gem._** Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at your feet.\n\n**_Jester._** You have Advantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Key._** A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears on your person. The GM chooses the weapon.\n\n**_Knight._** You gain the service of a **Knight**, who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your GM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The GM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired.\n\n**_Moon._** You gain the ability to cast *Wish* 1d3 times.\n\n**_Puzzle._** Permanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Rogue._** An NPC of the GM's choice becomes Hostile toward you. You don't know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a *Wish* spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\n**_Ruin._** All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\n**_Sage._** At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question.\n\n**_Skull._** An **Avatar of Death** (see the accompanying stat block) appears in an unoccupied space as close\n\nto you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another **Avatar of Death**. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each summon only one avatar as a consequence of this draw. A creature slain by an avatar can't be restored to life.\n\n**_Star._** Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 24.\n\n**_Sun._** A magic item (chosen by the GM) appears on your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit Points daily at dawn until you die.\n\n**_Talons._** Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish instead.\n\n**_Throne._** You gain proficiency and Expertise in your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim the keep as yours.\n\n**_Void._** Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A *Wish* spell can't return your soul to your body, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.\n\n> #### Avatar of Death\n> \n> *Medium Undead, Neutral evil*\n> \n> **AC** 20 \n>\n> **Initiative** +3 (13) \n>\n> **HP** Half the HP maximum of its summoner \n>\n> **Speed** 60 ft., Fly 60 ft.

    "desc": "This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter. You can take a Magic action to unfold a Portable Hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the Portable Hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane of existence, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open Portable Hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it. You can take a Magic action to close a Portable Hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing. If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the Portable Hole. A closed Portable Hole holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside. Placing a Portable Hole inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Handy Haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",

Terrain composed of rubble, rocks, or dirt isn't Difficult Terrain for you.

    "desc": "While holding this rod, you can take a Reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and doesn't create an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. A canceled spell dissipates with no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod has no effect on that spell. When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored. If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of level 5. You use the stored levels in place of your slots but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a level 3 spell slot. A newly found rod typically has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.",

    "desc": "This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below. Buttons. You can press one of the following buttons as a Bonus Action; a button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form: Button 1. A fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head. The flames shed Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice) that deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit. Button 2. The rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. Button 3. The rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. Button 4. The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though the rod's buttons remain within your reach. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form. Button 5. The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers. Button 6. The rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it. Drain Life. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an extra 4d6 Necrotic damage, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to half that Necrotic damage. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. Paralyze. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Paralyzed condition for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. Terrify. While holding the rod, you can take a Magic action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. A Frightened target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Regardless of its nature, the demiplane contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors, and the demiplane's environment can't harm its occupants. Everything else that can be interacted with there can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden there disappears if it is taken outside the demiplane. For each hour spent in the demiplane, a visitor regains Hit Points as if it had spent 1 Hit Point Die. Also, creatures don't age while there, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain there for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down). When the time runs out or you take a Magic action to end the effect, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod or an unoccupied space nearest that location.

    "desc": "This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.\n\nThe sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a *Sphere of Annihilation*, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 8d10 Force damage.\n\n**_Controlling the Sphere._** A *Sphere of Annihilation* is stationary until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a Magic action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, you control the sphere until the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature's control, that creature loses control of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you in a straight line.\n\nWhile in control of the sphere, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no other physical remains.\n\n**_Sphere Interactions._** If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal (such as that created by the *Gate* spell) or an extradimensional space (such as that within a *Portable Hole*), the GM determines randomly what happens using the following table.\n\n| 1d100 | Result                                                                                                                     |\n|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 01–50 | The sphere is destroyed.                                                                                                   |\n| 51–85 | The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.                                                    |\n| 86–00 | A spatial rift sends the sphere and each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere to a random plane of existence. |",

The snake is under your control and shares your Initiative count, taking its turn immediately after yours. On your turn, you can mentally command the snake (no action required) if it is within 60 feet of you and you don't have the Incapacitated condition. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. Absent commands from you, the snake defends itself. As a Bonus Action, you can command the snake to revert to staff form in its current space, and you can't use the staff's property again for 1 hour. If the snake is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it dies and reverts to its staff form; the staff then shatters and is destroyed.

    "desc": "This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge while choosing a point within 120 feet of yourself. That location becomes the point of origin of a spell or other magical effect determined by rolling on the Wand of Wonder Effects table. Spells cast from the wand have a save DC of 15. If a spell's maximum range is normally less than 120 feet, it becomes 120 feet when cast from the wand. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the GM determines randomly which among them are affected.\n\n**_Regaining Charges._** The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.\n\nTable: Wand of Wonder Effects\n| 1d100 | Effect |\n|-------|--------|\n| 01–20 | You cast a spell originating from the chosen point. Roll 1d10 to determine the spell: on a **1–2,** *Darkness*; on a **3–4,** *Faerie Fire*; on a **5–6,** *Fireball*; on a **7–8,** *Slow*; on a **9–10,** *Stinking Cloud*. |\n| 21–25 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you have the Stunned condition until the start of your next turn, believing something awesome just happened. |\n| 26–30 | You cast *Gust of Wind*. The Line created by the spell extends from you to the chosen point of origin. |\n| 31–35 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you take 1d6 Psychic damage. |\n| 36–40 | Heavy rain falls for 1 minute in a 120-foothigh, 60-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the chosen point of origin. During that time, the area of effect is Lightly Obscured. |\n| 41–45 | A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 60-foot-high, 30-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the chosen point of origin. The butterflies remain for 10 minutes, during which time the area of effect is Heavily Obscured. |\n| 46–50 | You cast *Lightning Bolt*. The Line created by the spell extends from you to the chosen point of origin. |\n| 51–55 | The creature closest to the chosen point of origin is enlarged as if you had cast *Enlarge/ Reduce* on it. If the target isn't you and can't be affected by that spell, you become the target instead. |\n| 56–60 | A magically formed creature appears in an unoccupied space as close to the chosen point of origin as possible. The creature isn't under your control, acts as it normally would, and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 Hit Points. Roll 1d4 to determine which creature appears. On a **1,** a **Rhinoceros** appears; on a **2,** an **Elephant** appears; and on a **3–4,** a **Rat** appears. |\n| 61–64 | Grass covers a 60-foot-radius circle of ground, with the center of that circle as close to the chosen point of origin as possible. Grass that's already there grows to ten times its normal size and remains overgrown for 1 minute. |\n| 65–68 | An object of the GM's choice disappears into the Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the chosen point of origin, and no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. If there are no such objects in range, nothing happens. |\n| 69–72 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you shrink as if you had cast *Enlarge/ Reduce* on yourself and remain in that state for 1 minute. |\n| 73–77 | Leaves grow from the creature nearest to the chosen point of origin. Unless they are picked off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours. |\n| 78–82 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, a burst of colorful, shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot Emanation. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. A creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. |\n| 83–87 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, you cast *Invisibility* on yourself. |\n| 88–92 | Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, a stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each worth 1 GP, shoots from the wand's tip in a Line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide toward the chosen point of origin. Each gem deals 1 Bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the Line. |\n| 93–97 | You cast *Polymorph*, targeting the creature closest to the chosen point of origin. Roll 1d4 to determine the target's new form. On a **1,** the new form is a **Black Bear;** on a **2,** the new form is a **Giant Wasp;** on a **3–4,** the new form is a **Frog.** |\n| 98–00 | The creature closest to the chosen point of origin makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the Restrained condition and begins to turn to stone. While Restrained in this way, the creature repeats the save at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends. On a failed save, the creature has the Petrified condition instead of the Restrained condition. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the *Greater Restoration* spell or similar magic. |",

The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly by rolling on the Feather Tokens table. The type of token determines its rarity.\n\n**Anchor (Uncommon).** You can take a Magic action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears. Bird (Rare). You can take a Magic action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a Roc, but it can't attack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the bird as a Magic action.\n\n**Fan (Uncommon).** If you are on a boat or ship, you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.\n\n**Swan Boat (Rare).** You can take a Magic action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-footlong, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take a Magic action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as a Magic action.\n\n**Tree (Uncommon).** You must be outdoors to use this token. You can take a Magic action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\n\n**Whip (Rare).** You can take a Magic action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then take a Bonus Action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 Force damage.\n\nAs a Bonus Action, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you take a Magic action to dismiss it, or when you die or have the Incapacitated condition.\n\n|1d100|Token|Rarity|\n|---|---|---|\n|01–20|Anchor|Uncommon|\n|21–35|Bird|Rare|\n|36–50|Fan|Uncommon|\n|51–65|Swan boat|Rare|\n|66–90|Tree|Uncommon|\n|91–00|Whip|Rare|",

It obeys your simple commands and can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the bird as a Magic action.\n\n**Fan (Uncommon).** If you are on a boat or ship, you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.\n\n**Swan Boat (Rare).** You can take a Magic action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-footlong, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take a Magic action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as a Magic action.\n\n**Tree (Uncommon).** You must be outdoors to use this token. You can take a Magic action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\n\n**Whip (Rare).** You can take a Magic action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then take a Bonus Action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 Force damage.\n\nAs a Bonus Action, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you take a Magic action to dismiss it, or when you die or have the Incapacitated condition.\n\n|1d100|Token|Rarity|\n|---|---|---|\n|01–20|Anchor|Uncommon|\n|21–35|Bird|Rare|\n|36–50|Fan|Uncommon|\n|51–65|Swan boat|Rare|\n|66–90|Tree|Uncommon|\n|91–00|Whip|Rare|",
